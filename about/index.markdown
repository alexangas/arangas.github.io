I've worked with SharePoint technology as an end user, administrator and developer since 2005 and similarly with Project Server since 2006. I love technology and find striving towards being the best at my craft an exciting and fascinating journey!

My origins in SharePoint began in Adelaide, Australia at a company running many convenience stores across the country. I then moved to Melbourne and focussed on Project Server consulting there for 1.5 years. Then it was off to London where I worked as a contractor in primarily SharePoint developer, consultant, and architect roles for almost 2.5 years. Now I'm back in little ol' Adelaide working for [OBS](http://www.obs.com.au), the best consulting company in Australia.
