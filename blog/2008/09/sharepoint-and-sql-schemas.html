<h1>SharePoint and SQL schemas</h1>
<p>I&#39;m just under two weeks away from installing the infrastructure update to a production environment. But of course these things need testing first so I started the install on the development environment. Thing&#39;s went hairy for a while...</p>
<p>First I must admit I&#39;m not running the update as the service account, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc671413.aspx">recommended by Microsoft</a>. This is because I&#39;m working in a locked down environment where trying to get the permission to do this requires a lot of questions, moaning and red tape. However both my account and the service account (there&#39;s only one service account in use here) are local administrators.</p>
<p>The log file pointed to by the SharePoint Configuration Wizard contains this ever so helpful line: &quot;An exception of type Microsoft.SharePoint.PostSetupConfiguration.PostSetupConfigurationTaskException was thrown.  Additional exception information: Failed to upgrade SharePoint Products and Technologies.&quot; However, with a little more digging there are details located at C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\LOGS. (This isn&#39;t actually the folder where I have directed diagnostic logs to, but for the purposes of an upgrade it seems SharePoint sometimes redirects it!) The logs contain errors over the several times I tried to upgrade...</p>
<p>Upgrade.log:</p>
<ul>
<li>SqlException: The default schema does not exist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SqlException: Cannot find the object &#39;MFN_Epm_GetAllCustomFieldsInformation&#39;, because it does not exist or you do not have permission.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SqlException: Cannot drop the function &#39;dbo.MFN_Epm_GetAllCustomFieldsInformation&#39;, because it does not exist or you do not have permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then in the ULS logs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The schema version (3.1.4.0) of the database SharePoint_AdminContent on server_x is not consistent with the expected database schema version (3.1.5.0) on server_x.  Connections to this database from this server have been blocked to avoid data loss.  Upgrade the web front end or the content database to ensure that these versions match.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SqlException: Cannot find the user &#39;DOMAIN\myusername&#39;, because it does not exist or you do not have permission.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Queue unable to interact with SQL. Queue type (Project Queue, Timesheet Queue etc): ProjectQ Exception: Microsoft.Office.Project.Server.BusinessLayer.Queue.QueueSqlException: PeriodicTasks failed ---&gt; System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Invalid object name &#39;MSP_QUEUE_RENDEZVOUS&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that I don&#39;t have permission to the databases. However, my account is db_owner on every database The service account permissions haven&#39;t been changed. What&#39;s going on?!! It turns out the root of the cause was described this exception: <strong>The default schema does not exist</strong>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know a great deal about the schema feature introduced with SQL 2005, however with every user added to a SQL 2005 box, an accompanying schema with the same name is also created. A colleague of mine who was doing some spring cleaning on our databases removed the schema for our service account, however the service account&#39;s SQL user was still trying to use it as its default schema! The solution was to change the schema to <strong>dbo</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the upgrade still didn&#39;t quite complete since I was part of the way through the upgrade when it fell over... I also had to create a fake MFN_Epm_GetAllCustomFieldsInformation function in the Reporting database so the upgrade could find and drop it (fortunately replaced with the new version in the upgrade).</p>
<p>It was a big relief that this ended up working. The downside is that my user account and a schema for it have been created on the database server. It can&#39;t be removed right now because the new database objects that come with the update have my schema set as their owner! Now I have to change them all...</p>
